# UFOs

# Overview
Dana wanted to provide users with a multipurpose site that is informative with the ability to narrow down searches of UFO sightings based off date, city, state, country, etc. 

# Results
I used: 
- [x] Javascript
- [x] HTML
- [x] Visual studio
- [x] Google Chrome
- [x] CSS 

## here shows the entire website :

## This demonstrates multiple filters used at once:

# Summary

I think that being able to narrow down per year instead of specific date would be easier to manipulate the data provided. A slight drawback if the user does not know the specific date of the incident.

Adding the amount of people that reported this incident would be an interesting addition. I personally would be curious to know how many people actually saw the UFOs listed in the data. 

Although the site is interactive with the data, I feel as though the entire site is sort of boring if you are looking for information on UFO's. I feel that the site needs more visual stimulation such as videos or other sources provided to further the users research.
